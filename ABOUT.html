	<h1>ABOUT</h1>
	<p> Since I was a little girl, I've always been interested in the <br> computer world <br> and how things simply work. </p>
	<p> I love to take every opportunity into something valuable <br> for me and for my future. <br> <p> After quitting volleyball, 
	programming has been a <br> way of escaping life <br> for hours and be at peace. </p>
